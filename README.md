# Voron Trident Build Log
Documentation of my Voron Trident 250mm Build!

Hopefully there may be helpful information in here for others :) 

## Specs
- Formbot 250mm Pro Kit
- Phaetus Dragon HF
- Polymaker Polylite Metallic Blue ABS 
- Polymaker Polylite Black ASA

## Notes
- Parts were printed on an Ender 3S1 Pro in a vented DIY enclosure: This was a VERY slow way to get the printed parts done (500mm/s^2 & 60mm/s)
- Parts printed according to Voron PIF specs
- So far it's sped up the build process by printing pieces in order of use in the manual


- ** Gather the manuals & write-ups / BOM's for each mod BEFORE printing, otherwise you will print parts you don't need! Ask me how I know :)
