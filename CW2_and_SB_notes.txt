### CW2:
- Pg 17 BMG Idler Assembly: formbot kit uses MR85 bearings instead of roller bearings
- Pg 21 Drive Assembly: Not needed, kit uses a pre-installed version
- Pg 34 Cable Cover: I overtightened the little M3x6 :( 

### SB
- Pg 55 Part Cooling Fan: Remove the front and DISCARD it, do not put back on. Also removed little snap tabs.

  Refer to TAP repo for rest of assembly
